# Start To Panic

Start To Panic is a turn based Plants Vs Zombies game developed using Java. 
The current version of the application plays the game in a GUI environment 
using point and click input from the player to determine the moves. 
The game has the player facing waves of zombies ensuring that the zombies are unable to reach the player who is to the left of the board. 
Zombies must be destroyed by planting mutant plants who are able to attack, defend and harvest sunlight. This game was made for SYSC 3110 at Carleton University

## Get Started

Run the Controller class to open the gui and start the game.

## Version

Version 2.0 

## Known Issues

The undo and redo buttons on the GUI and the extra buttons for future Plants have been disabled as they were not required implementations for the current version of the game. These are placeholders for future feature add-ons.

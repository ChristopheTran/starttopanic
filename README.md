# Start To Panic

Start To Panic is a turn based Plants Vs Zombies game developed using Java. The current version of the application plays the game in a console environment using console input from the player to determine the moves. The game has the player facing waves of zombies ensuring that the zombies are unable to reach the player who is to the left of the board.

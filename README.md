# Start To Panic

Start To Panic is a turn based Plants Vs Zombies game developed using Java. The current version of the application plays the game in a console environment using console input from the player to determine the moves. The game has the player facing waves of zombies ensuring that the zombies are unable to reach the player who is to the left of the board. Zombies must be destroyed by planting mutant plants who are able to attack, defend and harvest sunlight. This game was made for SYSC 3110 at Carleton University

## Get Started

## Version

Version 1.0 

## Known Issues

If a non int value is passed when the game prompts for an x and y value, the game will output an error and end the game. This specific portion of the implementation is temporary and will be changed when the transition to a GUI is made in the next version of the project.
